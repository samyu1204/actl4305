Modelling
- short tailed: get away with Lognormal or gamma
- if used poisson + severity => make sure mean and sd look okay for poisson
- market now use tree-based model - UK / AUS company use GBM
- for pet - less developed - not use GLM but use simpler model (tree?)

Tips on making GBM interpretable:
- use GBM, find key defining features - then plug those into the GLM
- UK really strong model in competitive market -- take competitor prices; how u compete is important
-- (but for this project - not permitted to use competitor price

Tips (from the fetch actuary early career):
- find homogeneous grouping - then comes up with the assessment of the risk
- use tools - GBM , clustering tools - to find the grouping
- even markov models are used to model state (healthy, sick)...

How to balance model knowledge vs domain knowledge
- data is relatively small - sense checking factors that are deems insignificant statiscally
- do different models, has diff answer, consider why has diff answer, consider back factor is causal or correlated
- sometimes less is more


Some factors that you believe are founded on solid hypothesis can really give you a market advantage

Tree models can give you dependent factors that we don't even think of 
-- use the relationship / interaction found in the tree models and then implement it into the glm


how we can understand how a person characteristic might affect claim can be crucial (hard to unlock)
- e.g. person go to vet for every little thing vs "it'll be fine"

Understand the actual underlying risk factor
- e.g., walk a lot vs not - not big difference
- house with stairs vs no stairs - big difference? (e.g., puppies falling from stairs = $18,000)
